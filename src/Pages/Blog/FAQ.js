              What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
              Not only are there are a lot of different kinds of state, but
              there often dozens of ways of managing each kind. Which should you
              choose? In this guide, we will uncover the several kinds of state
              in your React apps that you might not be aware of, plus how to
              manage them in the most effective way.{" "}
              <strong>The Four Kinds of React State to Manage. </strong>

              How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
              The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
              methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an
              object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
              Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
              object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
              The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
              test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
              important step in the development process, because if done
              correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
              more difficult to find in later testing stages.

            <h3 className="font-semibold">React vs. Angular vs. Vue?</h3>
            <p className="mt-1 dark:text-gray-400">
              Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn
              than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular
              and React with respect to their functionality like the use of
              components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is
              an easy option
